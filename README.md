# Four-in-a-Line Game

## Introduction
Welcome to the Four-in-a-Line repository! This project is a Java-based implementation of the popular two-player connection game where the goal is to connect four of one's own discs of the same color in a line, whether vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, while preventing your opponent from doing the same.

## Gameplay
Each player takes turns dropping a colored disc from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four discs wins the game.

## Features
- A simple and intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI).
- Two-player mode, with players taking turns on the same machine.

## How to Play
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile and run the Java program.
3. A game window will appear. 
4. Take turns with another player.

## Requirements
- Java 8 or higher.
